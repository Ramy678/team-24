# Week 4 Report – Orderly

## Project information
- **Name:** Orderly – Food Recommendation App
- **Short description:** A web app that helps users choose dishes from restaurant menus based on their preferences and budget.
- **License:** [MIT](../../LICENSE) 

## Product Backlog
- [Product Backlog board/view](https://github.com/orgs/Orderly-Team24/projects/2)
- [Current Sprint Backlog board/view](https://github.com/orgs/Orderly-Team24/projects/3)
- [Current Sprint milestone](https://github.com/Orderly-Team24/team-24/milestone/2)

### Sprint Details
- **Sprint Goal:** End-to-end flow works on the live deployment. Users fill a preferences questionnaire (with mandatory allergens), upload a menu photo, parser structures the menu data, and the recommender returns a dish that matches preferences, contains no allergens, and fits the budget.
- **Sprint Dates:** June 22 2026 – June 27 2026
- **Scope Summary:** Preferences questionnaire (with allergens), menu photo upload, budget filtering, and preference-aware dish recommendation. Public deployment via Docker.
- **Total Sprint Size:** 25 Story Points

## Delivery Summary
- **Delivered Product Changes:** Preferences questionnaire with allergen/diet fields, menu photo upload with OCR text extraction, menu parser (dish name + price structuring), AI recommender filtered by preferences, allergens, and budget, "Another option" flow without re-uploading menu, public deployment via Docker
- **Access/Run instructions:** [README.md](../../README.md)
- **Deployed Product (runnable artifact):** [product](https://team-24-navy.vercel.app/)

## Customer Feedback & Response
| Feedback Point | Resulting PBI / Issue |
| :--- | :--- |
| Preferences are not saved after page refresh; user has to re-enter them each time | new issue — Implement preferences persistence (cookies/localStorage) |
| "Another option" sometimes returns the same dish instead of a different one | new issue — Fix "Another option" to return distinct recommendations |
| Cuisine selection is not helpful, replace with taste-based preferences (sweet, spicy, etc.) | new issue — Replace cuisine selection with taste-based preferences |
| No order history yet | [#149](https://github.com/Orderly-Team24/team-24/issues/149) — US-015: Managing history of orders |

### Feedback Not Addressed
OCR and AI not connected to frontend - deferred to Sprint 3, requires additional development.

- **Testing** — unit + integration tests required, coverage ≥ 30% for critical modules.
- **Branch Protection** — PR approvals + CI required for merging.
