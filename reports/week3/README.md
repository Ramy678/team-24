- [MVP v1 filtered view](https://github.com/Orderly-Team24/team-24/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed%20milestone%3A%22Sprint%201%22)
- [Sprint 1 Milestone](https://github.com/Orderly-Team24/team-24/milestone/1)

### PBI types used
User Story — functional requirements from user perspective.
Task — technical implementation sub-items decomposed from User Stories.
Course Task — tracked work for course reporting/grading.

### Work Status
To Do -	In Product Backlog, not ready to start.
Ready -	Selected for Sprint, assigned, estimated, has description + AC.
In Progress -	Work started.
Review- Implementation ready for review, PR open.
Done - AC satisfied, DoD satisfied, PR/MR merged into protected default branch.

### Sprint milestone
Each Sprint = one GitHub Milestone.
Milestone groups all Sprint-selected PBIs.
Milestone shows:
- Progress, percentage of closed issues
- Due date, sprint end date
- Remaining work, open issues in the sprint

### MVP version tracking
Milestones = Sprint 1 -> MVP v1, Sprint 2 -> MVP v2, etc.
Labels = mvp-v1, mvp-v2, mvp-v3 on PBIs.

### Task decomposition
Split large tasks by technical sub-tasks (frontend, backend).
Each sub-task: 2–8 SP, independent, testable.
Naming: parent ID + sub-number (US-011-1, US-011-2, ...).

### Current (Sprint 1 — MVP v1):
Completed. Delivered US-011 (photo upload + AI recommendations).

### Next (Sprint 2 — MVP v2):
- US-002 (Login), US-004 (Preferences), US-005 (Allergens)
- [docs/roadmap.md](../docs/roadmap.md)
